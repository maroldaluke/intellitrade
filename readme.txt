lmarolda - intellitrade

Project Description:

The name of my project is Intellitrade. It is an interactive stock trading game, in which a user 
can choose from a variety of historical stock data, and can play a game in which the goal is to make 
as much money possible by trading that stock using technical analysis. The main component of the 
project is the user interface, which will display the stock’s price action over the period of a year, 
as well as a variety of basic technical indicators for your aid. You will be able to buy and sell, 
view your account information (profit/loss, etc.), view the stock’s price graph at different speeds 
and different zoom levels, view simple moving averages with different periods, view exponential 
moving averages with different periods, view the moving average convergence index, and the RSI 
indicator. Keep in mind, all of this is accomplished without any external modules. Additionally, you 
will be able to pause and draw support and resistance lines on the charts to analyze trends, and the game  
has an AI versus mode, where you play against the computer which will be buying and selling the stock 
using a rule-based model from data provided by the indicators.

How to Run Project:

Simply download the files, open the downloaded directory, open stock_trader_v0.py, and press 
"command + B" to run the game.

Libraries:

You do not have to download any specific libraries, but be sure that the csv stock files are in the
same folder as the python files, otherwise you will not be able to use the historical data. The program
uses the cmu_112_graphics package, which is already in the folder you downloaded. 

Shortcuts:

Not specific shortcuts, but press P to pause, and you can press S to take one step at a time while paused.
